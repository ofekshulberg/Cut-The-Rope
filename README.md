## Using Unity and C# i built a 2D simulation allowing you to set anchors for rope and then string them together.
### If you want you can cut them apart and let them dangle like actual rope, pretty cool :)

### PR Needed:
1. More ropes
2. More options
3. Some game mechanics
4. Some puzzles
5. Music and sound effects
6. Pretty much a whole game if you're up for it :)
